Gold Grid
 
Overview
Gold Grid  is a student management system designed to help administrators manage student data efficiently. It includes both a front-end interface and a back-end infrastructure that work together to provide features such as user management, dashboards, and time stamping. The app communicates with the back-end through APIs and stores data in a DynamoDB table.
 
Front-End
- Dashboard: A user-friendly interface for viewing and managing student information.
- Create New Users: Add new students or administrators to the system.
- Time Stamp: Record and manage time entries for various events or actions.
 
Back-End
- DynamoDB Table: The app's back-end includes a DynamoDB table for securely storing and managing student data.
- API Communication: Front-end and back-end communicate via APIs, handling data requests and updates.
 
AWS Services Used
- AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR): To store and manage Docker container images for deployment.
- AWS Lambda: For executing back-end functions such as API requests.
- AWS DynamoDB: A fast, fully managed NoSQL database to store student data.
- AWS API Gateway: To create and manage APIs that allow the front end to communicate with the back end.
- AWS CloudWatch: For monitoring and logging the performance of the app.
- AWS IAM: To manage access control for various AWS services used by the app.
