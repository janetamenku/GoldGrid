Project Nebula
Overview
Mission Name: Project Nebula
Objective:
Welcome to Project Nebula, a revolutionary initiative aimed at creating a centralized, interactive platform designed to enhance Azubi Africa's operational, educational, and community engagement efforts. By leveraging the power of cloud technologies, Python, Docker, and Linux, this project seeks to build a robust and scalable solution for students, educators, and the community.

Key Phases
Phase 1: The Blueprint (Front-End Expedition)
Dashboard Planet:
Build a personalized dashboard where students can track their journey and growth. This will provide an intuitive and interactive interface for users, allowing them to monitor key milestones, courses, and progress.

Configuration Site:
Test back-end and database connections, ensuring smooth data flow and interaction between components. This phase will focus on creating a stable foundation for data communication.

Phase 2: The Core (Back-End Odyssey)
API Blackholes:
Use Python to create APIs that bridge the gap between the front end and back end. These APIs will manage requests, responses, and data flows seamlessly, ensuring all components communicate effectively.

Database Supernova:
Utilize AWS services to build a secure, scalable, and efficient database that stores essential data. The database will be the project's backbone, managing everything from user profiles to educational content.

Dockerized Continuum:
Containerize the application using Docker to ensure it operates consistently across multiple environments, from development to production.

Tools and Technologies
AWS:
For secure, scalable, and reliable infrastructure, database services, and deployment.

Python:
The core programming language for API development and back-end logic.

Docker:
Containerization tool for ensuring consistent development, testing, and deployment environments.

Linux:
For a stable and secure server environment.
